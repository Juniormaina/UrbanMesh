# UrbanMesh — Product Status

**Stage:** Working MVP (demo-ready)  
**As of:** 21 September 2026  
**Pilot:** not started — see [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md)

UrbanMesh is a three-app prototype for Kilimani walkability & safety intelligence. Citizens can log geotagged hazards, the API auto-verifies nearby same-category reports (≥3 within 15 m), and county planners can read ward metrics and export an LPDP PDF. It is **not** yet ready for unsupervised public reporting.

## Verdict

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can we run the end-to-end demo? | **Yes** — seed + PWA report + heatmap + dashboard + LPDP PDF |
| Can residents use it unsupervised on the street? | **Not yet** — rate limiting stubbed; moderation and installable PWA hardening remain |
| Can the county treat output as operational evidence? | **Not yet** — seed-backed demo data, approximate ward boxes, no named LPDP desk access |
| What is the next product job? | Harden the reporting path (Phase 1), then put real Kilimani reporters on Argwings Kodhek and Kirichwa Kubwa |

## What’s live

| Surface | Port | What works today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Citizen web (`apps/web`) | `:5173` | Mobile map home, report flow, reports list, my reports, hazard evidence |
| County dashboard (`apps/dashboard`) | `:5174` | Overview, live map, clusters, analytics, LPDP evidence workspace |
| API (`apps/api`) | `:3001` | Report ingest + PostGIS clustering, verified listings, metrics, LPDP generate + download |
| Database | Postgres + PostGIS | `incidents` table, six hazard categories, `is_verified` / `cluster_id` |
| Seed | `npm run db:seed` | 53 Kilimani points; clusters A–D auto-verify; near-miss pairs E–F |

**Self-verifying rule (live):** same category, `ST_DWithin` on geography, default **≥ 3 reports within 15 m**. Env-configurable via `CLUSTER_RADIUS_METERS` / `CLUSTER_THRESHOLD`.

## Capability matrix

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPS hazard report | **Shipped** | Geolocation required |
| Six-category taxonomy (scoped) | **Shipped** | No crime / rationing domains |
| PostGIS 15 m self-verify | **Shipped** | Auto-verify + shared `cluster_id` |
| Client-side H3 index | **Shipped** | `h3-js` resolution 10 |
| Verified heatmap | **Shipped** | Leaflet.heat |
| Ward / category metrics | **Shipped** | Approximate bbox “wards” |
| LPDP A4 PDF | **Shipped** | Puppeteer HTML → PDF |
| Kilimani seed + demo script | **Shipped** | Argwings, Dennis Pritt, Ngong, Kirichwa |
| Photo upload | **Shipped** | `POST /api/v1/uploads/photos` |
| CORS | **Shipped** | `CORS_ORIGINS` |
| Low-bandwidth PWA posture | **Partial** | Lazy map; manifest present; no service worker yet |
| Rate limiting | **Stubbed** | Env only |
| Auth / planner ACL | **Missing** | Open local APIs |
| Moderation queue | **Missing** | Auto-verify is the only gate |
| Official ward polygons | **Missing** | Hardcoded boxes |

## Demo vs pilot

Current end-to-end contract:

1. Seed DB → verified clusters A–D on the heatmap  
2. Report near an Argwings near-miss pair → `Verified Cluster Created`  
3. Dashboard metrics + **Generate LPDP PDF**  

The 90-day pilot still needs partners (KCF, county LPDP desk), a reporter cohort, and Phase 1 hardening. Do not treat seed clusters as live citizen evidence.

## Product risks (engineering)

| Risk | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Unauthenticated ingest + PDF generation | Spam can inflate “verified” clusters |
| Rate-limit config unused | Documented but not enforced |
| Cluster id re-anchored on new matches | LPDP cluster identity can shift |
| Approximate wards | Not official Nairobi planning units |
