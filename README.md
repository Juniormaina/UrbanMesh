# UrbanMesh

**Crowdsourced walkability & safety intelligence for Kilimani — feeding Nairobi County’s Local Physical Development Plan (LPDP).**

Built primarily by **[Junior Maina](https://github.com/Juniormaina)** — product direction, architecture, integration, and shipping. AI coding tools (especially **Cursor**) accelerated implementation; they did not replace ownership of the problem, the spatial trust model, or the Kilimani-specific design choices.

Residents report mobility and infrastructure hazards in real time. When enough nearby reports agree, the platform **self-verifies** a spatial cluster, paints a live Walkability & Safety Heatmap, and compiles an LPDP policy brief for county planners.

Grounded in Kilimani’s scale: **~50,457 residents across 16.1 km²** (2019 census context), with pilot corridors on **Argwings Kodhek Road** and the **Kirichwa Kubwa** river corridor.

## Why it isn’t another complaint box

UrbanMesh is **not** an open inbox of unverified grievances. Trust is programmatic:

| Rule | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Self-verifying filter** | ≥ **3** same-category reports within **15 metres** (`PostGIS ST_DWithin` on geography) → `is_verified = true` + shared `cluster_id` |
| **Heatmap gate** | Only **verified** clusters feed the walkability & safety density layer |
| **Policy gate** | LPDP PDF entries are verified clusters labelled **“3+ Confirmed Citizen Reports”** |
| **Scoped hazards** | Six tangible point-hazard types only — no crime logs, no water-rationing schedules, no personal profiles |

That triangulation of **community reports + spatial clustering + planner-facing evidence** is the product differentiator.

---

## Operating constraints (Nairobi / Kilimani)

| Constraint | How UrbanMesh responds |
| --- | --- |
| **Low bandwidth** | Mobile-first PWA; lazy-loaded map bundle; Leaflet + compact Tailwind; report shell paints before the map chunk |
| **Privacy / security** | No public citizen profiles; reports on-device for “My Reports”; taxonomy excludes sensitive social/crime domains |
| **Trust** | Auto-verify is a **priority signal**, not unreviewed publish — community moderation stays in the pilot plan |
| **Planner utility** | One-click A4 LPDP policy brief from live verified clusters |

---

## How I built this (and how I used AI)

I, **Junior Maina**, did **most of the work** on UrbanMesh end to end: framing the Kilimani / LPDP problem, choosing the three-app architecture, defining the self-verifying spatial rule, wiring PostGIS + H3, shipping the citizen PWA and county dashboard, seeding corridor data, and keeping docs honest about what is live vs stubbed.

I used **AI coding tools as a force multiplier**, not as the author of the product:

| What I owned | How AI tools helped |
| --- | --- |
| Problem framing & scope (point hazards only; privacy boundaries) | Stress-tested wording and edge cases in conversation |
| Architecture (PWA + Express/Prisma/PostGIS + planner console) | Scaffolded folder layout and boilerplate faster |
| Self-verify rule (15 m / ≥3, same category) | Drafted Prisma `$queryRaw` / `ST_DWithin` ingest + clustering loops I then reviewed and hardened |
| Citizen map & report UX | Accelerated React/Leaflet/Tailwind UI and multi-step report flow |
| LPDP PDF pipeline | Generated HTML print templates + Puppeteer render script I edited for A4 / county tone |
| Seed realism (Argwings, Dennis Pritt, Ngong, Kirichwa) | Helped expand corridor points and near-miss pairs for demos |
| README / STATUS / roadmap | Kept documentation aligned with the actual codebase |

### Tools & workflow

- **Cursor** (agent + chat): primary environment — multi-file edits, repo-aware refactors, deliverable-sized prompts  
- **LLMs via Cursor**: TypeScript, SQL/PostGIS, React, Puppeteer, Tailwind  
- **My loop:** specify the civic constraint → ask for a thin vertical slice → run it → fix types/spatial edge cases → commit  

I deliberately worked **one deliverable at a time** (schema → ingest/cluster → PWA → dashboard/PDF → seed) so the agent stayed on rails and I stayed accountable for every merge.

### Example prompt I used

```text
Using the Incident schema, build POST /api/v1/reports that inserts a
PostGIS Point via $queryRaw, runs ST_DWithin(geography, 15m) for the
same HazardCategory, and if count ≥ 3 flips is_verified and sets
cluster_id to the new incident id. Return “Verified Cluster Created”
vs “Incident Logged - Pending Verification”.
```

That class of prompt — precise, geospatial, acceptance-testable — is how the self-verifying filter and LPDP path were scaffolded. **I reviewed, corrected, and integrated the output** into the monorepo.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choices |
| --- | --- |
| Citizen / dashboard UI | React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Maps | Leaflet, react-leaflet, leaflet.heat |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Spatial index | Uber H3 (`h3-js`, resolution 10) |
| API | Node.js, Express, TypeScript |
| ORM / DB | Prisma, PostgreSQL, PostGIS |
| Documents | Puppeteer (HTML → A4 PDF) |

## Hazard categories (strict scope)

| Enum | Plain-language label |
| --- | --- |
| `MOBILITY_SURFACE_DAMAGE` | Pothole / Broken Road Surface |
| `NMT_PEDESTRIAN_HAZARD` | Blocked Walkway / Pedestrian Barrier |
| `DRAINAGE_STORMWATER` | Flooding / Clogged Drain |
| `SEWER_SANITATION` | Open Manhole / Sewer Leak |
| `LIGHTING_SECURITY` | Unlit Street / Broken Light |
| `ILLEGAL_WASTE_DUMP` | Illegal Dumping / Waste Pile |

Out of scope by design: crime reporting, water rationing, personal identity, anonymous doxxing surfaces.

---

## Crowdsource verification (self-verifying filter)

On every `POST /api/v1/reports`:

1. Store the report as a PostGIS `geometry(Point, 4326)`  
2. Find same-category incidents within **15 metres** (`ST_DWithin` on geography)  
3. If **≥ 3** reports match → set `is_verified = true` and assign a shared `cluster_id`  
4. Response status:
   - `"Verified Cluster Created"`
   - `"Incident Logged - Pending Verification"`

Seed data includes full clusters (A–D) and near-miss pairs (E–F) so demos can show verified heat **and** a live third report flipping verification.

## Demo walkthrough (for video / stakeholders)

Punchy path (aim ≤ 2–3 minutes on camera):

1. Seed API + open the **mobile PWA map**  
2. Drop a geotagged hazard on **Argwings Kodhek** (near a near-miss pair)  
3. Show **Verified Cluster Created** when the 15 m / ≥3 rule fires  
4. County dashboard → **Generate LPDP PDF** → download the structured brief  

---

## Deploy (Vercel — citizen PWA)

- **Root Directory:** `apps/web` (or use root [`vercel.json`](./vercel.json))  
- **Output:** `dist`  
- **Env:** `VITE_API_BASE` = public API URL  

---

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) and `apps/*/.env.example`. Key knobs: `CLUSTER_RADIUS_METERS`, `CLUSTER_THRESHOLD`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `VITE_API_BASE`.

---

## 90-day pilot

Path from working MVP to a supervised street pilot (KCF hosting, reporter cohort, county LPDP desk):

- **[`STATUS.md`](./STATUS.md)** — what is live vs stubbed  
- **[`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md)** — Foundation → Community pilot → Validate & handover  

---
